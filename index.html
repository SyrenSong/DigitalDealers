                            \tWhat comes to your mind when you think of playing cards? Poker? Rummy? I think of my grandparents playing War and Go 
                            Fish! with me as a kid. But as we get older we lose our fine motor abilities. Things that were once easy seem 
                            impossible. I don’t want to stop playing cards with my grandparents but what if I’m also unable to shuffle cards?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Introducing the Digital Dealers Deck Shuffler! This device automatically shuffles a deck of cards, and we 
                            used this as a base to also check the deck for duplicates and make sure it is a full deck. In our case a full deck consists 
                            of 52 cards with no duplicates and 2 jokers. Our group recognizes that people dont only play with a deck of playing cards, 
                            what if youre playing UNO. So we added a button to turn off the feature which scans for a full deck incase the user does not 
                            wish to use it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many people struggle with shuffling, it can be as simple as not getting the motion right. Our group aims to make it 
                            just a bit easier.
